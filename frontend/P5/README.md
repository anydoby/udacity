====================

1.  The application is put together by bower. Thus you need to first install Node.js (if not already installed), 
    then install npm and install bower. Please see http://bower.io/#getting-started.
    
2.  After installing bower you can execute 
        
        bower update
   
   in the root of the project (where the bower.json file is located)

3. Bower will load all the required libraries for you. After that you can open the index.html in a browser.
